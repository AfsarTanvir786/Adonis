# Adonis

## PROJECT -> Adonis04_backend_auth
In this project, we used mySQL as database. You will find a good CRUD operation separating services, controllers, database etc.
You have to create your own .env file. 
```
TZ=UTC
PORT=3333
HOST=localhost
LOG_LEVEL=info
APP_KEY=
NODE_ENV=development
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=your_user_name
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
SESSION_DRIVER=cookie
```

Check out controllers, models, services directory in app directory.
also database/migrations directory, routes.

**`note:`**
Please correct me, if you find any mistake or any improvement through the project.
